# SCB Book - Social Network App

You can choose to run the app via Local Machine or hosted by Expo.

## Run Development or Production via Local Machine

### Install Expo CLI

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
npm start
```

Expo Dev Tools will automatically launch in your browser.

Either follow the prompts in the terminal, or select the prompts via Expo Dev Tools.

Ensure you have your simulator running, or install Expo on your device ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www)) and scan the QR code (send a link via email/SMS if using iOS).

### Testing

Tests can be run with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Run Production via Expo

The project has been published and hosted on [Expo](https://expo.io/@robhung/scb-social-networking-app).

You will need to download the Expo on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www).

On Android, you can simply scan the QR code or manually type the link / search for the project within the app.

On iOS, you will need to manually type this deep link (exp://exp.host/@robhung/scb-social-networking-app) on your phone, easiest would be in your Notes or Messages, and then tap on it to open the project within Expo Client. Alternatively, you can type this link (https://expo.io/@robhung/scb-social-networking-app) into your mobile browser and open the project using the button on the page. If you click directly on that link instead of typing it in, it will attempt to open the project within Expo Client but fail.
