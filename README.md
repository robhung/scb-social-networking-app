# SCB Book - Social Network App

You can choose to run the app via Expo or Local Machine, either works well.

## Run Production via Expo

The project has been published and hosted on [Expo](https://expo.io/@robhung/scb-social-networking-app).

You will need to download the Expo Client on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=www).

On Android, you can simply scan the QR code or manually type the link / search for the project within the app.

On iOS, you will need to click [here](exps://exp.host/@robhung/scb-social-networking-app) for the project to open as Apple have prevented the use of QR code scanning for their app. Easiest way would be to just type out the link, copy / paste / send to yourself or visit this repo on your device.

## Run Development or Production via Local Machine

### Install Expo CLI

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
npm start
```

Expo Dev Tools will automatically launch in your browser.

Either follow the prompts in the terminal, or select the prompts via Expo Dev Tools.

Ensure you have your simulator running, or install Expo on your device and scan the QR code (send a link via email/SMS if using iOS).

### Testing

Tests can be run with:

```bash
npm test
```
